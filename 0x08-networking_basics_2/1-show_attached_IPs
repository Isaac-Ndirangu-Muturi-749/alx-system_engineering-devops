# ifconfig -a: display information about all network interfaces, both active and inactive.
# grep inet: filters output to only include lines that contain the term "inet,"
# which typically indicates an IPv4 address.
# cut -d: -f2: uses ":" as a delimiter and extracts the second field from each line.
# In the context of IPv4 addresses in the output, this field contains the actual IP address.
# cut -d" " -f1:uses a space (" ") as a delimiter and extracts the first field from each line.
# This is done to further refine the output and remove any additional information that
# might be present on the same line.
